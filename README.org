* Simple NLP Examples

This repo provides a couple of simple python NLP examples using spacy, stanza,
and NLTK:

** [poc.py](./poc.py)

A proof of concept command line program that can download text files, load
them locally, or use a string as text, and tokenizes the text using spacy,
provididng a couple commands to print the text, list the entities, and list
and filter the tokens.

Kind of a mess.

[Sample usage at asciinema](https://asciinema.org/a/Sc7jFZJx7DkWKRGnJRbheAEx3)

** [token_filtering.py](./token_filtering.py)

Simple example of filtering out and printing tokens by type.

** [stanza_to_nltk.py](./stanza_to_nltk.py)

Converts a texed processed by stanza into an NLTK corpus
